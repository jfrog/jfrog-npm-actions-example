Example NPM Package with GitHub Actions and JFrog Platform Integration
This repository contains an example NPM package that demonstrates the flow of package creation and management while connecting to GitHub Actions and the JFrog platform. The purpose of this repository is to provide an example of how to integrate an NPM package with 
these technologies.

Getting Started
To use this example NPM package, you will need to have a JFrog account. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a trial account at www.jfrog.com.

Once you have a JFrog account, you can clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/example-npm-package.git
Package Creation and Management
This repository contains all the necessary files and configurations to create and manage an NPM package with GitHub Actions and the JFrog platform. The package is configured to be automatically built and deployed to the JFrog platform every time a new release is 
created on GitHub.

To create a new release and trigger the package build and deployment process, follow these steps:

Update the version number in the package.json file.

Commit the changes and create a new tag with the same version number:

css
Copy code
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
This will create a new release on GitHub and trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to build and deploy the package to the JFrog platform.

Check the JFrog platform to verify that the package was successfully built and deployed.
